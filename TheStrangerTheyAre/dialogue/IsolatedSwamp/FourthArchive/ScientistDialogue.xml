   <Page>My name is extremely difficult to write or pronounce in your language, but you can just call me "The Scientist".</Page>
   <Page>Before I left our ship, I was the head of the scientific committee. I was the first one to utilize green fire and invented the Vision Torch.</Page>
   <Page>But I was only a mere puppet of our leader. I could not invent, research, or do anything at all without his command and approval.</Page>
   <Page>I didn't want to tear down our home planet, but it was his orders. He made me build that ship regardless of how unhealthy conditions were.</Page>
   <Page>When I left, I put my assistant in charge. The committee thought I died in the crash, and didn't bother checking.</Page>
   <Page>And then, the simulation was built. I would have never approved of the idea, but I was better off out of there. I could have ended up imprisoned!</Page>

   <Page>Ah yes, my family. There were four of us. Me, my wife, my son, and my infant daughter.</Page>
   <Page>Our youngest was born on the ship, but due to lack of nutrients and poor atmosphere, she passed away only a week later.</Page>
   <Page>Because of our ship's lack in nutrients, no child could grow. So when my infant daughter died, I knew I had to do something.</Page>
   <Page>The three of us remaining left and crashed onto that cloaked moon.</Page>
   <Page>A few days later, my son was ill. The environment of our ship also got to him.</Page>
   <Page>Not long before I left to come back to the ship, he also ended up passing away.</Page>
   <Page>For the plan to work, my wife and I have to survive in order to repopulate. I have no idea if either one, or both of us died, and I never will find out.</Page>

   <Page>My kind had a deep connection with nature, something they couldn't live without on our ship.</Page>
   <Page>Before we found that vortex in the sky, which you have called "The Eye", we lived very simple and pleasant lives.</Page>
   <Page>We lived peacefully under the Ringed Giant rafting its rivers and counting the stars. Some of us had hobbies like building furniture, playing board games, and even fishing, which was our main source of food.</Page>
   <Page>Most of my kind was very spiritual, some even worshipping idols and making sacrifices.</Page>
   <Page>I was one of the few indivuals who didn't care for worship, in fact my whole family was that way.</Page>
   <Page>It was only natural for my kind to sacrifice the planet to reach the "Eye", as you call it. After all that, we were never the same.</Page>
   <Page>We also had animals on our home planet, but they died before we could even bring them on board.</Page>

   <Page>"The Stranger"? You mean our ship? Life was terrible there.</Page>
   <Page>We left The Stranger with 55 crew members. Many others were lost, including a popular singer. </Page>
   <Page>By the time I got back, 20 died before the simulation was created (including my kids, excluding my wife and I). You can go to the Starlit Cove Memorial to count them.</Page>
   <Page>You have to have seen the inside to get here, right? It may not look bad, but everywhere you look reminds you of what we did to our home moon.</Page>
   <Page>It drove my kind insane! Especially because we found out that vortex was not what we hoped it to be. It was bad enough we didn't have enough food supply to last us.</Page>
   <Page>But it gets worse! The poor environment caused my infant daughter to die a week after birth on that ship, and my son to die later on.</Page>
   <Page>The atmosphere in our ship is not enough to support the healthy growth of a child or the planting of crops, and we cannot continue to live like this.</Page>
   <Page>We don't have the technology to create a good enough ecosystem for a ship like this. There's barely any wind for trees to survive! And it wasn't even worth the sacrifice.</Page>
   <Page>Plenty of my kind have even took their own lives due to this madness, or starved to death due to lack of food.</Page>
   <Page>All the scientists and council members that burned the slide reels and hid the codes, all ended up ending their own lives.</Page>
   <Page>And our eldest crew member who died in the simulation while testing, he later extinguished his artifact because it wasn't the same as our real home moon.</Page>
   <Page>So I then built the coma hall to put their "undead" data into "sleep mode", and most of the simulation's populus came flocking over to get in it.</Page>
   <Page>If only I could have turned them around while I still could...</Page>

   <Page>My kind isn't really scientific, but two of our most important technologies are green fire, and light sensors. Everything's either made out of one or the other.</Page>
   <Page>Before the green fire technology, our kind didn't have much at all. We were basically primitive.</Page>
   <Page>And when we did discover green fire, our kind used them as drugs. So they were frowned upon for hundreds of years.</Page>
   <Page>But then one day, my father discovered something with it, its ability to image.</Page>
   <Page>And years later, I invented the Vision Torch, which then lead to the development of computers and telescopes, which use the fire's power.</Page>
   <Page>And then there's light sensors, which activate our doors, rafts, and drive our ships.</Page>
   <Page>Our ship's cloak is all natural resources we've mined from the cloaked moon. We didn't really have to configure it at all.</Page>

   <Page>A leader is someone who rules over a group of people. We actually had up to 11 leaders, but almost always, one leader is more powerful than the rest.</Page>
   <Page>Our most powerful leader usually wears yellow clothing, but his advisors who we deem "The Council" typically dress in red.</Page>
   <Page>The council members at the time I left our ship was at 11, including our leader. Council members also typically wear necklaces and bracelets.</Page>
   <Page>The color of clothing is apart of our social hierarchy. It goes from top to bottom: yellow, red, blue, gray, and brown. Necklaces and bracelets are signs of wealth and nobility.</Page>
   <Page>However, our leader was a tyrant since we found that vortex. He doesn't listen to his advisors, and may even imprison those who defy him.</Page>
   <Page>Those who refused to board the ship to reach the vortex were left home to starve, including one of our famous singers. Leaving home was truly a terrifying day.</Page>
   <Page>If only he listened to my warnings about building the ship, destroying our homeworld, and even the plan to terraform it back after.</Page>

   <Page>Angler's Eye? If you're talking about the cloaked moon, then I like what you named it.</Page>
   <Page>When we discovered what the vortex would do to our universe, we went there to mine out minerals for our ship's cloak.</Page>
   <Page>We found it when we were scanning the other planets in your system, but we predicted the trajectory wrong.</Page>
   <Page>For the terraforming plan, I was told by The Council to check to see if our homeworld was able to be terraformed, but we ended up crashing into the cloaked moon on our way there.</Page>
   <Page>The crash happened due to our false assumptions about its orbit. Turns out, this was not only a moon of the fifth planet, but also the vortex. It orbits the two bodies every 400,000 years.</Page>
   <Page>As my time on the cloaked moon went on, I found out that it was an "evil twin" of the mysterious moon that changes its orbits.</Page>
   <Page>It has a dangerous hurricane blocking the south pole that will kill you upon touching it, but one time I fell into the hurricane while holding one of those rocks...</Page>
