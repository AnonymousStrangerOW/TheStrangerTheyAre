            <Page>I'm glad Xylo left a clone of himself here. He may not be the same, but he's close enough!</Page>
            <Page>Hearing our home being terraformed successfully is way too good to be true, but it is!</Page>
			<Page>After all, I'm standing in front of my distant nephew. His horns, his clothing, nothing like the others on this ship.</Page>
			<Page>Ever since you left our ship that day Xylo, I deeply regretted not going with you. I was way too focused on that vortex.</Page>
			<Page>And what has that vortex given me? Eternal suffering in that prison. I should have listened, Xylo. It was too early to let that signal go. </Page>
			<Page>But then again, that signal brought us all here. I never even dared to think anyone would hear that signal.</Page>
			<Page>Thanks to you, blue friend, I am freed and reunited with my family. I could never forgive you enough.</Page>
