			<Page>Hey it's me Ernesto, the magic talking anglerfish.</Page>
			<Page>Now this isn't the time for fun and games, OK? I have something very important to tell you.</Page>
			<Page>Some ominous creature in a trench coat that dubbed itself as "Anonymous" came up to me, and it wanted me to pass on a warning.</Page>
			<Page>And the warning? It goes a little something like this.</Page>
			<Page>&lt;size=20&gt;*ahem*&lt;/size&gt;</Page>
			<Page>&lt;size=72&gt;DO NOT SHOOT YOUR SCOUT INTO THE EYE&lt;/size&gt;</Page>
			<Page>Yeah, a certain section has an elevator and an instrument that both don't work unless you launch your scout once when you find it.</Page>
			<Page>I know it's tempting, but you can just launch your scout right before you jump into the orb. Got it?</Page>
