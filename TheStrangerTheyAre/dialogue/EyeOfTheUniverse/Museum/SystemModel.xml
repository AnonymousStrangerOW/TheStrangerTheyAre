			<Page>The Stranger's Inhabitants once lived on a lush, green moon, which they destroyed to reach The Eye.</Page>
			<Page>Luckily, one individual stepped up and brought their dormant home back to life, and even repopulated the species!</Page>
			<Page>Hundreds of thousands of years later, they still live in harmony in a stagnant paradise, while doing everything to make sure they don't lose their home again.</Page>
			<Page>After destroying a Nomai Vessel and its clan, other Nomai clans reacted by putting a no-warp zone around our solar neighborhood.</Page>
			<Page>I even convinced Cypress, the current leader of the Strangers' Homeworld, to come with me to The Eye!</Page>
