      <Page>I've been training pilots since we founded Outer Wilds Ventures. I know that face when I see it.</Page>
      <Page>You should have seen Riebeck's when we were training them! They had no idea where they were going at first.</Page>
	  <Page>And do you know what I always told them? Just use your Little Scout to sense out the way! Shoot it at any surface and you can see where to land safely.</Page>
	  <Page>Hopefully that helped, Hatchling. I know you can do this.</Page>
