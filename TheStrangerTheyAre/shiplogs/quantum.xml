				<ID>QUANTUM_S1_LAB_TEXT3</ID>
				<Text>Shown in a picture on one of the tables is a scratch in the ice of the current state. The researchers say it marks the location of a light sensor submerged in the poison state. The sensor will be easier to find if an object that can emit light is placed near the scratch before changing states.</Text>
