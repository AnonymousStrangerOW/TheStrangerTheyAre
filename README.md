The Stranger They Are is a fairly large story mod based around the Echoes of the Eye DLC where you get to unravel the darkest secrets of The Stranger's Inhabitants. They may have lost everything...but their story is not over yet!

This mod has support for the [Achievements Mod](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/achievements/). If you want to get achievements in this mod, you'll need it.

For Developers: To build the mod from source, you will need to already have the mod installed via OWML. Reason being is the Slide Reel Cache is already generated and the AssetBundles are too big to be placed on the GitHub Repository.
